## üìù Problem Statement

Alright folks, listen up! We've got a fishy situation on our hands. Clique Bait, an online seafood store, is run by the CEO Danny, who thinks he's a hotshot data analyst. He wants us to help him calculate funnel fallout rates for his store. Our mission, should we choose to accept it, is to dive deep into his dataset and come up with creative solutions to identify where customers are dropping off in the sales funnel. Danny wants to expand his knowledge of the seafood industry, and we're gonna help him do just that by optimizing his sales funnel and boosting his conversion rates. Let's show him how it's done!

The tables are pretty self-explanatory based on the column names but here are some further details about the dataset:

- Users table shows the customers who visit the Clique Bait website are tagged via their cookie_id..

- Customer visits are logged in this events table at a cookie_id level and the event_type and page_id values can be used to join onto relevant satellite tables to   obtain further information about each event.The sequence_number is used to order the events within each visit.

- The event_identifier table shows the types of events which are captured by Clique Bait‚Äôs digital data systems.

- The campaign identifier table shows information for the 3 campaigns that Clique Bait has ran on their website so far in 2020.

- This page hierarchy table lists all of the pages on the Clique Bait website which are tagged and have data passing through from user interaction events.

### A. Digital Analysis

Using the available datasets - answer the following questions using a single query for each one:

1. How many users are there?
2. How many cookies does each user have on average?
3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?
4. What is the number of events for each event type?
5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?
6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?
7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?
8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?
9. What are the top 3 products by purchases?

---
### B. Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

  * How many times was each product viewed?
  * How many times was each product added to cart?
  * How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
  * How many times was each product purchased?
  
Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:
1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?
2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?
3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?
4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?
5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?

---
### C. Campaigns Analysis

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

  * `user_id`
  * `visit_id`
  * `visit_start_time`: the earliest event_time for each visit
  * `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
  * `art_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
  * `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
  * `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
  * `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
  * `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
  * (Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with 
  products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the `sequence_number`)

---

### D. Bonus Questions

1. Some ideas to investigate further include:

   - Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event.
   
   - Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
   
   - What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them      with users who have just an impression but do not click?
   
   - What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to each other?

## C. Before and After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time. 
Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect. 
We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before.

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:
  
#### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
  
  ```sql
with cte as(select 
sum(case when week_ between '21' and '24' then sales end) as before_weeks,
sum(case when week_ between '25' and '28' then sales end) as after_weeks
from cleaned_weekly_sales
where Year_='2020')
select *,after_weeks-before_weeks as growth,round((after_weeks-before_weeks)*100/(before_weeks),2) as pct_change
from cte;
```
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121611397/233737587-e7ccc3c7-37ef-4b1c-be9e-3c7c5caadc30.png)

 #### 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
  
    ```sql
set @week_change=25;
with cte as(select 
sum(case when week_ between @week_change-12 and  @week_change-1 then sales end) as before_weeks,
sum(case when week_ between  @week_change and  @week_change+11 then sales end) as after_weeks
from cleaned_weekly_sales
where Year_='2020')
select *,after_weeks-before_weeks as growth,round((after_weeks-before_weeks)*100/(before_weeks),2) as pct_change
from cte;
```
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121611397/233737885-cdf15025-aa57-4905-a1f1-6ffdcd73bf2d.png)

  
 #### 3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?
  
  - For 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15.
  
    ```sql
with cte as(select Year_ ,
sum(case when week_ between @week_change-4 and @week_change-1 then sales end) as before_weeks,
sum(case when week_ between @week_change and @week_change+3 then sales end) as after_weeks
from cleaned_weekly_sales
group by Year_)
select *,after_weeks-before_weeks as growth,round((after_weeks-before_weeks)*100/(before_weeks),2) as pct_change
from cte;
  ```
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121611397/233738060-6f0530f5-c67a-43fd-b31e-3e7d282b15c5.png)
 
   - For 12 weeks before and after 2020-06-15.
  
    ```sql
with cte as(select Year_,
sum(case when week_ between @week_change-12 and  @week_change-1 then sales end) as before_weeks,
sum(case when week_ between  @week_change and  @week_change+11 then sales end) as after_weeks
from cleaned_weekly_sales
group by Year_)
select *,after_weeks-before_weeks as growth,round((after_weeks-before_weeks)*100/(before_weeks),2) as pct_change
from cte;
  ```
