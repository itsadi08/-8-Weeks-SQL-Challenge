## üìù Problem Statement

The objective of this case study is to optimize the operations of Pizza Runner, a pizza delivery service founded by Danny. The project will involve analyzing data from several areas, including pizza metrics, runner and customer experience, ingredient optimization, pricing, and ratings. The data in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables needs to be cleaned up to enable accurate data manipulation. Using SQL queries, the team will seek to answer key questions to help Pizza Runner improve its overall efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize profits. The end goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to take Pizza Runner to the next level of success.

The columns are pretty self-explanatory based on the column names but here are some further details about the dataset:

- The runners table shows the registration_date for each new runner.

- The customer_orders table captures pizza orders with pizza_id, exclusions, and extras columns. Customers can order multiple pizzas with varying exclusions and extras values, requiring data cleanup before using in queries.

- The runner_orders table in Pizza Runner captures the assignment of each order to a runner, along with pickup time, distance, and duration of the delivery.

- At the moment - Pizza Runner only has 2 pizzas available the Meat Lovers or Vegetarian!

- Each pizza_id has a standard set of toppings which are used as part of the pizza recipe.

- This table contains all of the topping_name values with their corresponding topping_id value.

### C. Ingredient Optimisation

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
2. What was the most commonly added extra?
3. What was the most common exclusion?
4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
    * ```Meat Lovers```
    * ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef```
    * ```Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon```
    * ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers```
5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
    * For example: ```"Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"```
6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

---
### D. Pricing and Ratings

1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
    * Add cheese is $1 extra
3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
    * ```customer_id```
    * ```order_id```
    * ```runner_id```
    * ```rating```
    * ```order_time```
    * ```pickup_time```
    * Time between order and pickup

### E. Bonus questions

If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an ```INSERT``` statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new ```Supreme``` pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

## D. Pricing and Ratings
### Q1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

```TSQL
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN p.pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 12
        ELSE 10 END) AS money_earned
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN pizza_names p
  ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN #runner_orders_temp r
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL;
```
| money_earned  |
|---------------|
| 138           |

---
### Q2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
* Add cheese is $1 extra
```TSQL
DECLARE @basecost INT
SET @basecost = 138 	-- @basecost = result of the previous question

SELECT 
  @basecost + SUM(CASE WHEN p.topping_name = 'Cheese' THEN 2
		  ELSE 1 END) updated_money
FROM #extrasBreak e
JOIN pizza_toppings p
  ON e.extra_id = p.topping_id;
```
| updated_money  |
|----------------|
| 145            |

---
### Q3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
```TSQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ratings
CREATE TABLE ratings (
  order_id INT,
  rating INT);
INSERT INTO ratings (order_id, rating)
VALUES 
  (1,3),
  (2,5),
  (3,3),
  (4,1),
  (5,5),
  (7,3),
  (8,4),
  (10,3);

 SELECT *
 FROM ratings;
 ```
| order_id | rating  |
|----------|---------|
| 1        | 3       |
| 2        | 5       |
| 3        | 3       |
| 4        | 1       |
| 5        | 5       |
| 7        | 3       |
| 8        | 4       |
| 10       | 3       |

* ```customer_id```
* ```order_id```
* ```runner_id```
* ```rating```
* ```order_time```
* ```pickup_time```
* Time between order and pickup
* Delivery duration
* Average speed
* Total number of pizzas

```TSQL

  c.order_time,
  r.pickup_time,
  DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time) AS mins_difference,

  ROUND(AVG(r.distance/r.duration*60), 1) AS avg_speed,
  COUNT(c.order_id) AS pizza_count
FROM #customer_orders_temp c
JOIN #runner_orders_temp r 
  ON r.order_id = c.order_id
GROUP BY 
  c.customer_id,

### Q5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
```TSQL
DECLARE @basecost INT
SET @basecost = 138

SELECT 
  @basecost AS revenue,
  SUM(distance)*0.3 AS runner_paid,
  @basecost - SUM(distance)*0.3 AS money_left
FROM #runner_orders_temp;
```
| revenue | runner_paid | money_left  |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 138     | 43.56       | 94.44       |

## üî• Bonus Questions

### If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

```TSQL
INSERT INTO pizza_names (pizza_id, pizza_name)
VALUES (3, 'Supreme');

ALTER TABLE pizza_recipes
ALTER COLUMN toppings VARCHAR(50);

INSERT INTO pizza_recipes (pizza_id, toppings)
VALUES (3, '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12');
```
Notice that I had to update the column ```toppings``` because the Supreme pizza had all the toppings.
