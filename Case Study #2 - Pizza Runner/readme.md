## üìù Problem Statement

The objective of this case study is to optimize the operations of Pizza Runner, a pizza delivery service founded by Danny. The project will involve analyzing data from several areas, including pizza metrics, runner and customer experience, ingredient optimization, pricing, and ratings. The data in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables needs to be cleaned up to enable accurate data manipulation. Using SQL queries, the team will seek to answer key questions to help Pizza Runner improve its overall efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize profits. The end goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to take Pizza Runner to the next level of success.

The columns are pretty self-explanatory based on the column names but here are some further details about the dataset:

- The runners table shows the registration_date for each new runner.

- The customer_orders table captures pizza orders with pizza_id, exclusions, and extras columns. Customers can order multiple pizzas with varying exclusions and extras values, requiring data cleanup before using in queries.

- The runner_orders table in Pizza Runner captures the assignment of each order to a runner, along with pickup time, distance, and duration of the delivery.

- At the moment - Pizza Runner only has 2 pizzas available the Meat Lovers or Vegetarian!

- Each pizza_id has a standard set of toppings which are used as part of the pizza recipe.

- This table contains all of the topping_name values with their corresponding topping_id value.

### A. Pizza Metrics

1. How many pizzas were ordered?
2. How many unique customer orders were made?
3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

---
### B. Runner and Customer Experience

1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

---
### C. Ingredient Optimisation

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
2. What was the most commonly added extra?
3. What was the most common exclusion?
4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
    * ```Meat Lovers```
    * ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef```
    * ```Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon```
    * ```Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers```
5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
    * For example: ```"Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"```
6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

---
### D. Pricing and Ratings

1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
    * Add cheese is $1 extra
3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
    * ```customer_id```
    * ```order_id```
    * ```runner_id```
    * ```rating```
    * ```order_time```
    * ```pickup_time```
    * Time between order and pickup
    * Delivery duration
    * Average speed
    * Total number of pizzas
5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

---
### E. Bonus questions

If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an ```INSERT``` statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new ```Supreme``` pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

### Q3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
	
```sql
drop table if exists ratings;
create table ratings (
order_id integer,
rating integer);
insert into ratings
(order_id, rating)
values
(1,4),
(2,5),
(3,3),
(4,5),
(5,2),
(6,null),
(7,3),
(9,null),
(8,4),
(10,4);

 SELECT *
 FROM ratings;
	
 ```

### Q4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
* ```customer_id```
* ```order_id```
* ```runner_id```
* ```rating```
* ```order_time```
* ```pickup_time```
* Time between order and pickup
* Delivery duration
* Average speed
* Total number of pizzas

```sql
Select customer_id,o.order_id,runner_id,rating,order_time,pickup_time,
--extract (minute from 
(pickup_time-order_time)as Time_between_order_pickup, duration as Delivery_duration,
round((distance*60/duration),2) as Average_speed,count(pizza_id) as Total_number_of_pizzas
from customer_ordersnew o
join runner_ordersnew using (order_id)
join ratings using (order_id)
where cancellation is null
group by customer_id,o.order_id,runner_id,rating,order_time,pickup_time,
extract (minute from (pickup_time-order_time)), duration,
(distance*60/duration);
  ```

### Q5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
	
```sql
with total_price as (select sum(case when pizza_id = 1 then 12 else 10 end) as total_amount
from runner_ordersnew 
join customer_ordersnew
using(order_id)
where cancellation is null),
delivery_charges as(select sum(distance)*0.3 as delivery_cost from runner_ordersnew)
select round((total_amount-delivery_cost),1) money_left from total_price,delivery_charges
```

## üî• Bonus Questions

#### If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new      Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

```sql
Create table pizza_namesnew as Select* from pizza_names

insert into pizza_namesnew (pizza_id, pizza_name)
values (3, 'Supreme');

Create table pizza_recipesnew1 as Select* from pizza_recipesnew

INSERT INTO pizza_recipesnew1 (pizza_id, toppings)
VALUES (3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(3,8),(3,9),(3,10),(3,11),(3,12);
	
```
 * Showing 15 rows out of total 26 rows.

 <br> 
 
 
 * Insights into customer preferences and ordering patterns at the restaurant:
	
      * ```Meatlover_pizzas``` are more ```popular``` than vegetarian pizzas, with 75% of total orders being for meatlovers. 
	
      * ```Standard_pizzas``` with standard toppings are also a ```popular_choice```, accounting for almost 50% of all orders.
	
      * ```Wednesdays``` and ```Saturdays``` are the ```busiest_days```, with 5 orders placed each.
	
      * ```Orders were placed at different times of the day```, including lunchtime (1 pm), in the evening (around 6 pm), and late at night (11 pm).
	
* Insights into delivery operations and performance of runners at the restaurant:	
	
     * ```Runner 3 arrives at the restaurant in 10 minutes on average```, while Runner 1 and Runner 2 take 15 and 23 minutes respectively to arrive. This information 		can help the restaurant optimize their delivery operations by assigning deliveries to the fastest runner to ensure timely delivery of orders to their 		  customers.
	
     * On average, a ```single pizza takes 11-12 minutes to prepare```, but this time can increase if the quantity is more. However, the average time to prepare a 	  pizza drops to 9-10 minutes when quantity is more.
	
     * ```Orders are coming from an average distance of 10 km to 25 km```, with Runner 2 covering the most distance of approximately 24 km, while Runner 3 covered only 	10 km.
	
     * The ```shortest delivery time was 10 minutes```, and the ```longest delivery time was 40 minutes```, with an ```average speed of around 45 km/hr per order```.
	
     * ```Runner 1 has a 100% successful delivery record```, while Runner 2 and Runner 3 have a 75% and 50% success rate respectively, due to order cancellations.
	
     * Runner 2's speed of 94 km/hr for order #8 is way too fast compared to other deliveries. It is possible that there is a misspelling error in the distance for the       customer with ID 102, and the actual distance to their address is 13.4 km, not 23.4 km 
	
* Insights into Popularity of Ingredients:

     * ```Bacon is the most popular extra ingredient```, and it was added to 4 pizzas. This suggests that bacon is a popular choice among customers who like to customize their pizzas. 
  
     * ```Similarly, cheese is the most common exclusion, and it was excluded from 4 pizzas. This could be due to various reasons, such as dietary restrictions or personal preferences.
 
     * Ingredients  that are popular among customers are,Bacon is the most frequently used ingredient with a total quantity of 12. It is followed closely by mushrooms with a quantity of 11, and cheese with a quantity of 10.

     * ```BBQ sauce is the most frequently used sauce with a quantity of 8```, followed by tomato sauce with a quantity of 3. This will be useful for the restaurant in terms of understanding which sauces are popular and how much of each sauce to keep in stock.

* Insights into Pricing and Ratings:

     * The ```total revenue generated``` from pizza sales, considering 9 Meat Lovers pizzas sold at $12 each and 3 Vegetarian pizzas sold at $10 each, is ```$138```.
