## üìù Problem Statement
Join Danny's latest venture at Data Mart! As the mastermind behind an online supermarket specializing in fresh produce, Danny needs your expertise to analyze the sales performance following a large-scale supply change. In June 2020, Data Mart implemented sustainable packaging methods throughout their entire farm-to-customer process. Now, Danny is seeking your help to measure the quantifiable impact of this change and identify which platforms, regions, segments, and customer types were most affected. Let's work together to discover the answers and find ways to minimize future sustainability updates' impact on sales.

## üîê Entity Relationship Diagram

</p>

The columns are pretty self-explanatory based on the column names but here are some further details about the dataset:

- Data Mart has international operations using a multi-region strategy.

- Data Mart has both, a retail and online platform in the form of a Shopify store front to serve their customers.

- Customer segment and customer_type data relates to personal age and demographics information that is shared with Data Mart.

- Transactions is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and sales is the actual dollar amount of purchases.

- Each record in the dataset is related to a specific aggregated slice of the underlying sales data rolled up into a week_date value which represents the start of the   sales week.

### A. Data Cleansing Steps
  
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the ```data_mart``` schema named ```clean_weekly_sales```:
  * Convert the ```week_date``` to a ```DATE``` format
  * Add a ```week_number``` as the second column for each ```week_date``` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
  * Add a ```month_number``` with the calendar month for each ```week_date``` value as the 3rd column
  * Add a ```calendar_year``` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
  * Add a new column called ```age_band``` after the original ```segment``` column using the following mapping on the number inside the ```segment``` value

| Segment | age_band     |
|--------|--------------|
| 1      | Young Adults |
| 2      | Middle Aged  |
| 3 or 4 | Retirees     |
  
  * Add a new ```demographic``` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the ```segment``` values
  
| segment | demographic |
|---------|-------------|
| C       | Couples     |
| F       | Families    |
  
  * Ensure all ```null``` string values with an ```"unknown"``` string value in the original ```segment``` column as well as the new ```age_band``` and ```demographic``` columns
  * Generate a new ```avg_transaction``` column as the sales value divided by ```transactions``` rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

---
### B. Data Exploration
  
1. What day of the week is used for each ```week_date``` value?
2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?
3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?
4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?
5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform
6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?
7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?
8. Which ```age_band``` and ```demographic``` values contribute the most to Retail sales?
9. Can we use the ```avg_transaction``` column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

---
### c. Before & After Analysis
  
This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.
Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.
We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before.

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

---

### D. Bonus Questions

1. Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?
  * ```region```
  * ```platform```
  * ```age_band```
  * ```demographic```
  * ```customer_type```
  
2. Do you have any further recommendations for Danny‚Äôs team at Data Mart or any interesting insights based off this analysis?

group by age_band,demographic
order by total_sales desc;
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121611397/233735677-33b917b0-b563-4860-9fe5-296e732b5830.png)
  
#### 9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
  
Hence, we can not use avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year and sales platform, because while calculating the average of the resultant averages we are giving equal weightage to all the average values but in reality all the columns have different weightage so it's better to calculate the sum of all the sales and divide it by total transactions.
  Example:-
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121611397/233737168-f592dd5f-ac1c-4e27-9bec-d255b31b6308.png)

  
```sql
select year_, platform, round(avg(avg_transaction),2) as avg_transaction_col,
round(sum(sales)/sum(transactions),2) as avg_transaction_group
from cleaned_weekly_sales
group by year_, platform
order by  year_, platform;
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121611397/233735782-c0b20208-b92e-4674-a2d5-77b98c8f648c.png)

 #### 3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?
  
 - For 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15.
