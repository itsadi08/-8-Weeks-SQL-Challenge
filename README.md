Alright, listen up foodies! Our man Danny is a Japanese cuisine lover who decided to start his own restaurant, Danny's Diner, at the beginning of 2021. But after a few months of operation, Danny's feeling the heat and needs our help to keep his dream alive.

Danny's captured some basic data about his customers, but he's not sure how to use it to improve his business. So let's dig in and help him out! We need to answer some key questions, like when customers visit, how much they're spending, and which menu items they can't get enough of. With our expert analysis, we can help Danny turn his diner into a hot spot for Japanese food lovers everywhere. So let's get to work and show Danny some love for his passion!

## üçï Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner

Hey, did you know that people worldwide consume over 115 million kilograms of pizza daily? That's a whole lotta dough! Speaking of dough, our boy Danny stumbled upon a killer idea while scrolling through his Instagram feed: "80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!" Genius, right? But Danny knew he needed more than just pizza to make bank, so he launched Pizza Runner, the Uber of the pizza world!

Danny started by recruiting runners to deliver his fresh pies (from his house, no less) and maxed out his credit card to hire freelance developers to build a slick mobile app for taking orders. But here's the thing: Danny's got lots of questions about Pizza Runner, from pizza metrics to ingredient optimization to pricing and ratings. And he wants answers, fast!

So, SQL gurus, it's time to flex those data manipulation skills. But first, we gotta clean up that messy data. There are null values and wonky data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables, so let's get to work! Once we've tidied things up, we can dive into those juicy questions and help Danny take his pizza empire to the next level.

Here's how you can help Danny: View the [case study](https://github.com/itsadi08/8-Weeks-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%232%20-%20Pizza%20Runner/README.md) and the [solution](https://github.com/itsadi08/8-Weeks-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%232%20-%20Pizza%20Runner#-sql-queries-for-questions) here.
